## Tweet from the omnibar

<h6><em>Hands down, the fastest way to write a tweet.</em></h6>

<h5>
Simply open a new tab (cmd + t), type 't' and a space, write your tweet, hit enter and it posts!<br>
You don't even have to "Sign in twitter" to authorize the app, everything just works!<br>
Feel free to fork, add the feature you want, and suggest the change back to the main project with a pull request.<br>
