#### Tweet from the omnibar


<h6><code>
    Hands down, the fastest way to write a tweet.
    
    Simply open a new tab (cmd + t), type 't' and a space, write your tweet, hit enter and it posts!

    You don't even have to "Sign in twitter" to authorize the app, everything just works!

    Feel free to fork, add the feature you want, and suggest the change back to the main project with a pull request.
