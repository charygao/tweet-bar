Right now it's opinionated to KissMetrics\n\n* **String.contains**\n\n  **_Coming in EcmaScript 6!!!_**\n  \n  `var string = 'https://github.com';`\n\n  `string.contains('https') === true`\n\n* **storageDefault**, Default localStorage items:\n\n  `storageDefault('thing', 'bar');`\n\n  This only writes the value to localStorage if the key is currently _**not**_ defined.\n\n* **createElement**\n\n  Lightly enhanced wrapper on `document.createElement`, simply accepts additional arguments for more easily setting properties, and attributes:\n\n  <code>\nvar div = createElement('div', {\n\n          innerHTML: 'foo', \n          id: 'bar'\n      }, {\n\n          'explicitly-an-attribute': 'baz'\n      });\n</code>\n\n* **runInPage**\n  \n  _This is only relevant for chrome extensions, feel free to strip it out._\n  \n  This method simply runs some javascript functions or strings of code _in the context of the page's dom, outside of Chrome's isolated world_\n\n  `runInPage('//these comments screw things up because... '+\n    'evenThisFunctionCallIsCommentedOut();');`\n\n    `runInPage(function(){\n      /*this is better*/\n    });`\n\n#And last but not least: [<h1>`nodeReady`</h1>](https://github.com/devinrhode2/node-ready)\n\n<h2>It's too awesome to document here, go learn about it at the above link.\n\nInstall\n---------------\n\n    npm install extension-include\n\nCreator\n---------------\n\nIs Devin Rhode.
